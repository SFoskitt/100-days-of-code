# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -3: Friday, January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked and updated the repo, read the articles, updated my Twitter <-- in preparation to start this challenge on Monday.

**Thoughts:** After reading the rules, I'm approaching this with a fair amount of trepidation - a little worried.  But that is why it's called a challenge, no?  One hour of Netflix every night is not a challenge.  One hour of code not related to work will definitely be interesting.

### Day 1: Monday, January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Learn Python the Hard Way" notes and exercises through Chapter 20

**Thoughts:** I host a bi-weekly Python meetup learn-along.  We are five meetings into this and I keep saying "I need to take notes on this".  Guess what.  I did.  It took more than an hour but was totally worth it because I now have these notes in Anki for spaced repetition.  Hooray.

### Day 2: Tuesday, January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Learn Python the Hard Way" exercises Chapter 21, 22, 25

**Thoughts:** Fun because this was work done with others.

### Day 3: Wednesday, January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More notes from "Learn Python the Hard Way" covering the new stuff we worked on last night.  Also, I poked at the HackerRank.com problem we couldn't finish last night.

**Thoughts**: I'm tired and need to do this earlier in the day, rather than the last thing before bed.  It's keeping me up.

### Day 4: Thursday, January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I looked at RxJS to use in a side (non-work) project.  This includes some short videos on Egghead.io

**Thoughts**: It's the same problem I had yesterday - I started late in the evening.  I am resolved to at least start the daily hour of code within 30 minutes of getting home from work, or maybe just do this after work hours while I'm at the office sat in front of a laptop.

**Link to work**: Not my work, but a couple articles, GitHub readme.md, and some Egghead.io videos on RxJS that I went through tonight:

### Day 5: Friday, January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Light research on Python websocket servers, and how to import dependencies into Python.  Websocket, not a new concept to me.  But adding dependencies to Python is new, and as it turns out, not hard at all.

**Thoughts**: Having one and a third languages under my belt has made learning Python easier.

**Link to work**: None (this is a project for work)

### Day 6: Saturday, January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Python today, but it's a websocket server and client - in the simplest form.  The server will say "hello" every two seconds and pass the message to the client.  Awesome!

**Thoughts**: Just scratching the surface on Python wervers and it's kind of exciting.

**Link to work**: None (it will be used for a work project)

### Day 7: Monday, January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Python today.  Exercise 22 from "Learn Pythong the Hard Way" which entails going back through the previous chapters and make a cheat sheet of terms.  I got through eleven chapters, here's the result so far.

**Thoughts**: Surprised to find how dense this book is, there's a whole lot in there!

### Day 8: Tuesday, January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuation of yesterday - more notes for Exercise 22 from "Learn Pythong the Hard Way".

**Thoughts**: Still surprised to find how dense this book is, there's a whole lot in there!

### Day 9: Wednesday, January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Python again, but it's some exercises from a random site here: http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html

**Thoughts**: Happy to see I'm learning something.  I made it through three of these four exercises without referencing the PyDocs.org!

### Day 11: Saturday, January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Python problems today on [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard).

**Thoughts**: There's absolutely no substitute for coding, in the process of learning to code.

### Day 15: Wednesday, January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Playing with JavaScript closures.

**Thoughts**:  Remember when you used to know what this was but currently find it confusing?  Time to brush up.

### Day 16: Friday, January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Remembered the fantastic service Exercism.io and finished the first, second, and third Python exercises.

**Thoughts**: So glad to start playing with unit tests in Python.  And these Exercism exercises dive right into Python classes, which I haven't touched yet.

**Link to work**: Uploaded my work with Exercism to this new repository, both the Python work and previous Javascript work:

### Day 17: Saturday, January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started adding Pytest unit tests onto the previous "46 Simple Python Exercises" I was working on earlier this week.

**Thoughts**: Struggles with Pytest in conjunction with sys.argv.  More in the blog.

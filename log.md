# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -3: Friday, January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked and updated the repo, read the articles, updated my Twitter <-- in preparation to start this challenge on Monday.

**Thoughts:** After reading the rules, I'm approaching this with a fair amount of trepidation - a little worried.  But that is why it's called a challenge, no?  One hour of Netflix every night is not a challenge.  One hour of code not related to work will definitely be interesting.

### Day 1: Monday, January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Learn Python the Hard Way" notes and exercises through Chapter 20

**Thoughts:** I host a bi-weekly Python meetup learn-along.  We are five meetings into this and I keep saying "I need to take notes on this".  Guess what.  I did.  It took more than an hour but was totally worth it because I now have these notes in Anki for spaced repetition.  Hooray.

**Thoughts:** Fun because this was work done with others.

### Day 3: Wednesday, January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More notes from "Learn Python the Hard Way" covering the new stuff we worked on last night.  Also, I poked at the HackerRank.com problem we couldn't finish last night.

**Thoughts**: I'm tired and need to do this earlier in the day, rather than the last thing before bed.  It's keeping me up.

### Day 4: Thursday, January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I looked at RxJS to use in a side (non-work) project.  This includes some short videos on Egghead.io

**Thoughts**: It's the same problem I had yesterday - I started late in the evening.  I am resolved to at least start the daily hour of code within 30 minutes of getting home from work, or maybe just do this after work hours while I'm at the office sat in front of a laptop.

**Link to work**: Not my work, but a couple articles, GitHub readme.md, and some Egghead.io videos on RxJS that I went through tonight:

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -3: Friday, January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked and updated the repo, read the articles, updated my Twitter <-- in preparation to start this challenge on Monday.

**Thoughts:** After reading the rules, I'm approaching this with a fair amount of trepidation - a little worried.  But that is why it's called a challenge, no?  One hour of Netflix every night is not a challenge.  One hour of code not related to work will definitely be interesting.

### Day 1: Monday, January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: "Learn Python the Hard Way" notes and exercises through Chapter 20

**Thoughts:** I host a bi-weekly Python meetup learn-along.  We are five meetings into this and I keep saying "I need to take notes on this".  Guess what.  I did.  It took more than an hour but was totally worth it because I now have these notes in Anki for spaced repetition.  Hooray.

### Day 3: Wednesday, January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More notes from "Learn Python the Hard Way" covering the new stuff we worked on last night.  Also, I poked at the HackerRank.com problem we couldn't finish last night.

**Thoughts**: I'm tired and need to do this earlier in the day, rather than the last thing before bed.  It's keeping me up.
